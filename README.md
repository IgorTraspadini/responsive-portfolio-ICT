# Responsive Portifolio
## About the Project
A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 
Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. 
This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:
- When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
- When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
